* Please read deployment/database/HowToDockerDB.txt file and setup the database first.


1. Under deployment folder, copy the .env.sample file and save it as .env file, replace the following key values:
    # the network name is define in deployment/databases/docker-compose-dev.yml
    NETWORK_NAME=crams-apps-network

2. Make sure you have updated the local_settings.py under crams-apps/crams_api/local folder


3. Make sure the Django db config settings are right in crams-apps/crams_api/local/local_settings.py
   Make sure the db host is the same network as in deployment/database/docker-compose-dev.yml (network section)

4. Run docker compose commands:

   # bring the docker container down:
   > docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down

   # build the docker container
   > docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build

   # start the crams api without deamon:
   > docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up

   # start the crams api with deamon:
   > docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d

   # stop the crams api:
   > docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down
